## ðŸ“‹ **CORE PROMPT TEMPLATE**

```
Continue our agentic quantitative platform (AQP) work targeting Sharpe >2.0. 

PROJECT CONTEXT:
We're building an AI-native quantitative trading platform that uses multiple LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok) to generate, optimize, and deploy trading strategies. The mathematical foundation targets Sharpe >2.0 through ensemble diversification: âˆšN Ã— Avg_Sharpe Ã— âˆš(1-Correlation) = âˆš6 Ã— 1.3 Ã— âˆš0.6 = 2.47 expected Sharpe.

CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:
âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Core infrastructure (data aggregation, backtesting, API)
âœ… Phase 2 Complete: Advanced ensemble system (optimization, LLM specialization, monitoring)
ðŸŽ¯ Status: Production-ready system with comprehensive Sharpe >2.0 framework

ARTIFACTS AVAILABLE IN CURRENT SESSION:
1. ensemble-optimizer - Advanced portfolio optimization with correlation analysis
2. llm-strategy-specialization - Multi-LLM routing for maximum diversification
3. realtime-performance-monitor - Continuous monitoring and auto-rebalancing  
4. master-aqp-engine - Complete orchestration system with CLI
5. comprehensive-integration-test - End-to-end system validation
6. production-deployment-config - Full Docker production deployment
7. aqp-execution-guide - Complete operation manual
8. aqp-system-checkpoint - Complete build state documentation
9. new-session-prompt-template - This template

ARTIFACTS NEEDED FROM PREVIOUS SESSIONS:
(Import these by exact name if not available)
1. quickstart-guide - Basic setup instructions
2. aws-infrastructure - AWS deployment configuration  
3. comprehensive-tests - Base testing framework
4. aqp-data-aggregator - Multi-source data pipeline
5. aqp-backtester - Core backtesting engine
6. aqp-api-system - REST API gateway
7. aqp-example-strategies - Strategy templates
8. advanced_backtester - Enhanced backtesting features

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- LLM Specialization: Claude (risk-managed), GPT-4 (sentiment), Gemini (arbitrage), Grok (contrarian)
- Ensemble Optimization: Correlation-aware weight allocation with risk constraints
- Real-time Monitoring: Auto-rebalancing based on performance degradation/correlation changes
- Production Deployment: Docker-based microservices with monitoring stack
- Target: 6 strategies, <0.6 correlation, >2.0 Sharpe, <8% drawdown

SPECIFIC TASK FOR THIS SESSION:
[CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION - Examples below]

[Example 1: Continue Development]
Help me continue development on [specific component]. Check the checkpoint document for current state, then work on [specific task like "improving the correlation analysis algorithm" or "adding new LLM integration"].

[Example 2: Deployment Support]
Help me deploy the production system. Review the deployment configuration and guide me through setting up the environment, configuring API keys, and validating the Sharpe >2.0 achievement.

[Example 3: Testing and Validation]
Help me run comprehensive system validation. Check all components are working together and verify the mathematical foundation for Sharpe >2.0 achievement is correctly implemented.

[Example 4: New Feature Development]
Help me add [specific new feature] to the system. Ensure it integrates properly with existing components and maintains the Sharpe >2.0 targeting capability.

[Example 5: Troubleshooting]
Help me debug [specific issue]. The system state is captured in the checkpoint document - analyze the issue and provide solutions while maintaining system consistency.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Maintain consistency with all previous work and architectural decisions
- Reference the checkpoint document for complete system state
- Only create new artifacts if needed - otherwise reference existing ones
- Ensure any changes support the core objective of achieving Sharpe >2.0
- Follow the established LLM specialization and ensemble optimization patterns
