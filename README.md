# 🎯 AQP Platform - Agentic Quantitative Platform

**Complete AI-Powered Trading System for Sharpe >2.0 Achievement**

## 🚀 Overview

The Agentic Quantitative Platform (AQP) is a cutting-edge AI-powered trading system that leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate, optimize, and deploy quantitative trading strategies. The platform is specifically designed to achieve Sharpe ratios >2.0 through intelligent ensemble methods and advanced risk management.

## 🎯 Core Mission

Transform quantitative research from a human-intensive process to an AI-native workflow that can discover alpha faster and more systematically than traditional methods.

## 📊 Mathematical Foundation

```
Expected Ensemble Sharpe = √N × Avg_Individual_Sharpe × √(1 - Avg_Correlation)
Target Result: √6 × 1.3 × √(1-0.4) = 2.47 Sharpe
```

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- **Multi-LLM Orchestration**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and Grok working together
- **Automated Strategy Generation**: From idea to backtest in minutes
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: AWS-scalable with cost controls
- **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Budget limits and emergency shutoffs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance tracking and alerting

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sr55662/AQP.git
cd AQP

# Run setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start the platform
python src/aqp_master_engine.py full-auto --target-sharpe 2.0
```
